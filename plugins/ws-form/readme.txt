[Upgrade to WS Form PRO](https://wsform.com/?utm_source=wp_plugins&utm_medium=readme).

= Mobile Friendly =

WS Form forms are mobile friendly and scale to fit different device sizes. By upgrading to [WS Form PRO](https://wsform.com/?utm_source=wp_plugins&utm_medium=readme) you can take advantage of the responsive feature that enables you to create different form layouts for different device sizes (breakpoints).

= Performance =

WS Form was built with enterprise level performance in mind. WS Form does not interfere with the loading of other page or post content on your website and isolates submission records to ensure as your website grows your page load speed is not affected.

All form code is HTML 5 compliant and if your website theme uses a framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation WS Form automatically outputs code to suit that framework. This means your form loads as fast as possible without any unnecessary overhead typically found in other WordPress form plugins.
